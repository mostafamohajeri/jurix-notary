## Requirements

To run the code you will need
* Java 11+
* sbt 1.5.5+
* eFLINT 3 [here](https://gitlab.com/eflint/haskell-implementation)
* eFLINT java API [here](https://gitlab.com/eflint/eflint-actors/java-implementation)

To compile, after installing eFLINT and eFLINT's java API, go to the root directory and run `sbt compile`

## Implementation

The scenarios are implemented in a test suite in `/src/test/scala`.
